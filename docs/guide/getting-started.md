# Getting Started

Welcome to the Frontend knowledge base! This comprehensive guide is designed to help you prepare for senior-level front-end engineering interviews.

## 🎯 What This Guide Covers

This knowledge base contains **100+ topics** across:

- **JavaScript** - Core concepts, advanced features, and design patterns
- **TypeScript** - Type system, generics, and advanced types
- **React** - Components, hooks, state management, and testing
- **Next.js** - App Router, Server Components, and advanced features
- **Browser APIs** - Rendering, performance, and web platform features
- **Security** - XSS, CSRF, CSP, and authentication
- **Performance** - Optimization techniques and Core Web Vitals
- **Accessibility** - ARIA, keyboard navigation, and best practices
- **Tooling** - Build systems, bundlers, and development tools
- **Styling** - CSS architectures, frameworks, and layout

## 📖 Document Structure

Each topic follows a consistent dual-mode structure:

### ⚡ Quick Revision

- **2-3 minute read** for rapid recall
- Bullet points with essential concepts
- Code examples demonstrating key patterns
- Common pitfalls to avoid

### 🧠 Deep Understanding

Expandable sections covering:

- **Why this exists** - Historical context and problems solved
- **How it works** - Internal mechanisms and runtime behavior
- **Common misconceptions** - What people often get wrong
- **Interview angle** - What interviewers specifically test

## 🚀 Study Strategies

### Strategy 1: Topic-by-Topic (Comprehensive)

Ideal if you have 1-2 weeks before interviews.

1. Start with JavaScript core concepts
2. Move to TypeScript fundamentals
3. Deep dive into React ecosystem
4. Study Next.js if relevant to role
5. Review browser, performance, and security
6. Practice with tooling and advanced topics

### Strategy 2: Quick Revision (2-3 Days)

Focus only on **⚡ Quick Revision** sections.

**Day 1: Foundations**

- JavaScript: scope, closures, event loop, this, async
- TypeScript: generics, utility types, type narrowing
- React: reconciliation, hooks, state management

**Day 2: Advanced & Framework**

- React: Fiber, concurrent rendering, patterns
- Next.js: App Router, caching, Server Components
- Browser: rendering path, Core Web Vitals
- Security: XSS, CSRF, CSP

**Day 3: Polish & Practice**

- Review weak areas
- Practice coding problems
- Mock interview scenarios

### Strategy 3: On-Demand (Reference)

Use search to find specific topics as needed during:

- Mock interviews
- Coding practice
- Real interview prep
- Post-interview review

## 🔍 Using Search Effectively

The built-in search is powerful. Try these strategies:

**Search by concept:**

- "closure"
- "reconciliation"
- "type narrowing"

**Search by pattern:**

- "debounce"
- "memoization"
- "HOC"

**Search by problem:**

- "memory leak"
- "re-render"
- "CORS error"

**Search by technology:**

- "React 18"
- "HTTP/2"
- "JWT"

## 📝 Practice Tips

### Code Along

Don't just read - implement concepts:

```javascript
// Practice implementing patterns from scratch
function debounce(func, delay) {
  // Your implementation here
}

// Test your understanding
const debouncedFn = debounce(() => console.log("called"), 300);
```

### Create Examples

Relate concepts to real projects:

- Where have you used closures?
- When did you optimize performance?
- What state management have you implemented?

### Teach Others

Best way to solidify understanding:

- Explain concepts to a friend
- Write blog posts
- Answer Stack Overflow questions
- Create tech talks

## 🎤 Interview Preparation Checklist

Before your interview:

- [ ] Review core JavaScript concepts
- [ ] Practice TypeScript type challenges
- [ ] Implement common React patterns
- [ ] Understand framework architecture (React/Next.js)
- [ ] Study performance optimization techniques
- [ ] Know security best practices
- [ ] Practice explaining trade-offs
- [ ] Prepare real project examples
- [ ] Review system design basics
- [ ] Practice coding on whiteboard/online editor

## 💬 During the Interview

### Communication

- **Think aloud** - Share your thought process
- **Ask questions** - Clarify requirements before coding
- **Discuss trade-offs** - Show you understand pros/cons
- **Be honest** - It's okay to not know everything

### Problem Solving

- **Start simple** - Get basic solution working first
- **Optimize gradually** - Don't prematurely optimize
- **Consider edge cases** - Show thoroughness
- **Test your code** - Walk through examples

### Senior-Level Expectations

- **Architecture decisions** - Why this pattern over another?
- **Performance implications** - How will this scale?
- **Code maintainability** - Can team understand this?
- **Team collaboration** - How would you review this?

## 🎓 After the Interview

### Learn from Experience

- Note questions you struggled with
- Review topics you were weak on
- Practice patterns you missed
- Update your knowledge base

### Keep Learning

- Follow React/Next.js updates
- Read MDN for web standards
- Study open-source codebases
- Join developer communities
