# 🚀 Senior Frontend Interview Preparation

Welcome to the comprehensive guide for senior-level frontend engineering interviews. This resource covers all major topics you'll encounter in technical interviews at top tech companies.

## 📚 What's Inside

This documentation is organized into **11 major domains** covering the entire frontend ecosystem:

### Core Languages
- **📘 JavaScript** - Execution context, closures, prototypes, async patterns, and advanced concepts
- **🔷 TypeScript** - Type system, generics, utility types, and advanced type manipulation
  
### Frameworks & Libraries
- **⚛️ React** - Components, hooks, reconciliation, fiber architecture, and concurrent features
- **▲ Next.js** - App router, server components, streaming, and optimization techniques

### Browser & Network
- **🌐 Browser** - Rendering pipeline, APIs, web components, and core web vitals
- **🔌 Network** - HTTP/HTTPS, caching strategies, CORS, authentication

### Best Practices
- **🔒 Security** - XSS, CSRF, CSP, and security best practices
- **⚡ Performance** - Optimization, lazy loading, virtualization, and avoiding re-renders
- **♿ Accessibility** - ARIA, keyboard navigation, screen readers

### Modern Development
- **🎨 Styling** - CSS-in-JS, CSS modules, Tailwind, and modern CSS features
- **🛠️ Tooling** - Webpack, Vite, Babel, build systems, and development tools

## 🎯 How to Use This Guide

Each topic follows a **dual-mode structure**:

### ⚡ Quick Revision (2-3 minutes)
- Concise bullet points for rapid review
- Key concepts at a glance
- Code snippets for quick reference
- Perfect for last-minute preparation

### 🧠 Deep Understanding
Collapsible sections covering:
- **Why this exists** - The problem this concept solves
- **How it works** - Internal mechanisms and implementation details
- **Common misconceptions** - What people often get wrong
- **Interview angle** - What senior engineers are expected to know

## 💡 Study Strategy

### For Interview Prep
1. **First Pass**: Read Quick Revision sections of all topics in a domain
2. **Deep Dive**: Expand Deep Understanding for areas you're less confident
3. **Practice**: Implement code examples and variations
4. **Review**: Use Quick Revision for daily review before interview

### For Learning
1. Start with fundamentals (JavaScript Core, React Core)
2. Progress to advanced topics (Fiber, Concurrent Rendering)
3. Explore patterns and best practices
4. Study real-world applications (Next.js, Performance)

## 🔍 Search Tips
